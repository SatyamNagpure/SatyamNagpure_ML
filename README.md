Machine Learning Lab

Overview of Labs
Lab 1: Cost Function
Objective: Explore and implement the cost function for linear regression.
Description: This lab introduces the concept of the cost function, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), and shows how it is used to measure the performance of a machine learning model.


Lab 2: Linear Regression
Objective: Build linear regression from scratch.
Description: This lab covers the basics of linear regression, including hypothesis functions, gradient descent, and the calculation of model parameters.

Lab 3: Logistic Regression & Multiclass Logistic Regression
Objective: Implement logistic regression for binary classification and extend it to multiclass classification.
Description:
Part 1: Binary logistic regression.
Part 2: Multiclass logistic regression using the one-vs-all approach to handle multiple classes.


Lab 4: Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Objective: Apply SVM for regression and classification tasks.
Description:
Part 1: Implement Support Vector Regression (SVR).
Part 2: Implement Support Vector Classification (SVC) using both linear and non-linear kernels


Lab 5: Decision Trees
Objective: Implement decision trees for classification tasks.
Description: This lab demonstrates decision tree models, tree pruning techniques, and evaluation on different datasets.
